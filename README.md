## Avantages
In order to make the Abricot-Normiette more popular, we have designed a website to support its effectiveness and offer a real-time demonstration!

This website aims to make it easy to discover Abricot-Norminette.

## How does it works ?

As regularly in my projects, the backend is in ExpressJS. However, this time I chose Angular as the frontend. This choice is part of my goal to discover new languages, libraries and frameworks.

The main technical challenge of the site was to offer an online version of Abricot-Norminette, displaying a report on a compressed file provided by the user. The challenge was to find the compromise between security and stability. The deployment was particularly complicated.
